Automation can create leverage or create chaos. The difference is sequencing.

## First automations to prioritize

### Lead scoring and routing

Route high-intent leads immediately to the right owner.

### Follow-up orchestration

Automate first-response, reminder cadence, and qualification prompts.

### Campaign iteration engine

Automate variant testing for messaging and CTA combinations.

## What to avoid early

- Automating brand voice before positioning is stable.
- Building complex attribution models before basic tracking is clean.
- Launching AI chat workflows without clear escalation paths.

## 60-day scorecard

Use a concise scorecard:

- Response time trend.
- Qualified lead rate.
- Cost per qualified opportunity.
- Sales cycle compression.

## Conclusion

Fast ROI from AI marketing comes from automating conversion-critical workflows before adding broader complexity.
