Operational drag often hides in plain sight: duplicate tools, unclear handoffs, and missing accountability loops.

## Core AI-COO responsibilities

- Build process visibility across teams.
- Define role ownership for execution steps.
- Track KPI movement in real time.
- Trigger interventions when timelines slip.

## Productivity architecture

### Weekly control tower

An AI control tower can summarize project progress, blocked tasks, and forecasted delivery risk.

### Automated status intelligence

Instead of manual updates, systems can synthesize signals from tickets, CRM records, and communication tools.

### Pilot plan discipline

Pulse-style pilot plans assign owners, milestones, and review checkpoints so execution remains measurable.

## Final thought

Operations is a revenue problem, not an admin problem. AI-enabled operating systems convert effort into consistent outcomes.
