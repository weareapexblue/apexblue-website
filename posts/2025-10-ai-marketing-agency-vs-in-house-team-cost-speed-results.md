The agency vs in-house decision is not purely financial. It is a timing and capability decision.

## Agency model advantages

- Faster launch velocity.
- Proven playbooks across multiple industries.
- Less hiring overhead and onboarding delay.

## In-house model advantages

- Deep internal context.
- Long-term process ownership.
- Tight integration with company culture.

## Hybrid model for most startups

Many teams win with a hybrid approach:

1. Use an AI marketing agency to build core systems.
2. Transition repeatable workflows to internal hires.
3. Keep strategic audits external for objective optimization.

## Decision filter

Choose based on runway, urgency, and execution maturity rather than preference alone.
