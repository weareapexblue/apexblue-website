If your team is running campaigns manually while competitors use AI-assisted optimization, you are likely paying a tax in speed and efficiency.

## Signs your current model is falling behind

- Creative tests take too long to launch.
- Budget allocation is based on lagging metrics.
- Follow-up cadence is inconsistent.
- Performance reporting is disconnected from planning.

## Migration checklist

- Clarify target outcomes (pipeline quality, CAC reduction, conversion velocity).
- Integrate campaign, CRM, and analytics sources.
- Automate one workflow before scaling to all channels.
- Define weekly review rituals with both growth and leadership teams.

## Outcome expectation

A structured transition can create better channel discipline and faster decision cycles without sacrificing brand consistency.
