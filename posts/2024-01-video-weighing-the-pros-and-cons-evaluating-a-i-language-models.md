## What the video covers

- How model quality differs across planning, generation, and reasoning tasks.
- Where bias, hallucination, and controllability risks show up in production workflows.
- Why teams should evaluate model fit by use case instead of popularity.

## Practical selection criteria

When choosing a model for marketing and execution systems, prioritize:

- Output consistency under repeated prompts.
- Ability to follow formatting and process constraints.
- Cost-to-value ratio at your expected usage volume.
- Human review requirements for brand, legal, and compliance risk.

## Recommended rollout pattern

1. Start with one high-impact workflow and clear KPIs.
2. Compare at least two model candidates against the same prompt set.
3. Add human QA checkpoints before scaling automation.
