AI has moved from novelty to infrastructure. Companies now use it to improve decisions, automate routine tasks, and discover growth opportunities faster.

## Strategic effects of AI adoption

### Product improvement

AI improves recommendation quality, search relevance, and customer support responsiveness.

### Marketing precision

Growth teams can analyze intent patterns and deliver better-timed campaigns.

### Financial planning

Forecasting models provide earlier warning signals for demand changes and risk exposure.

## What leadership teams should do now

1. Build AI literacy across departments.
2. Prioritize one high-impact workflow for automation.
3. Define governance for privacy, bias, and quality control.
4. Scale only after measurable wins.

## Long-term perspective

The competitive edge will not come from using AI once. It will come from consistently learning faster than peers.
